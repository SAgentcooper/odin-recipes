        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        <p>This is my family's favorite pancake recipe that I threw together one day.</p>
        <p>It's inspired by fall (my favorite season!), using spices found in pumpkin pie. Use of whole wheat flour is a wholesome twist!</p>
        <p>Feel free to add fresh berries before or after cooking the pancakes!</p>
        
        <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>1 cup white whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Sift whole wheat flour and white whole wheat flour into a mixing bowl and add baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice.</li>
            <li>Combine milk, eggs, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Beat using an electric mixer until combined. Mix into flour mixture until evenly blended, being careful not to overmix, as having lumps in the mixture is okay.</li>
            <li>Drop 1/4 cup batter onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
