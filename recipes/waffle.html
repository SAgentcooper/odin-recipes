        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        <p>This is a traditional waffle recipe. It makes tasty, crunchy waffles.</p> 
        <p>They are very good with syrup, or my personal favorite is waffles topped with whipped cream and fresh strawberries!</p>

        <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups rolled oats</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>4 eggs, separated</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Mix flour, oats, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Beat egg yolks in another bowl, reserving egg whites in a third bowl. Add buttermilk, milk, and melted butter to egg yolks; beat until well mixed. Pour buttermilk mixture into flour mixture; beat until batter is blended.</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites and vanilla extract in a glass or metal bowl until soft peaks form. Fold half the egg whites into the buttermilk batter until egg whites are incorporated; repeat with remaining half.</li>
            <li>Ladle batter into preheated waffle iron. Cook until waffles are golden and crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer waffle to a paper towel-lined plate to prevent sogginess and repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
