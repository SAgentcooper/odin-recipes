        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        <p>This French delicacy is extremely versatile, as it can be filled with virtually anything - fruits, pudding, mousse for desserts as well as vegetables and meat for dinner.</p>
        <p>No need to add more oil each time unless the pan begins to stick.</p>
        <p>Freeze extra crepes for later use.</p>

        <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a blender combine eggs, milk, flour, salt and oil. Process until smooth. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and brush with oil. Pour 1/4 cup of crepe batter into pan, tilting to completely coat the surface of the pan. Cook 2 to 5 minutes, turning once, until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
